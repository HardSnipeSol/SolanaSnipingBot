Is a sniper bot profitable?

It depends.

Are you sniping newly launched tokens, are they with locked liquidity/burned or you are copytrading?

Assuming you are sniping recently launched tokens, be aware that before a token is damaged, 
you have around 15-20 seconds to buy and sell before it rugs to 0.
It is challenging to accomplish this with a free RPC and an average gas fee. 
In the early phases, when the token price is fluctuating a lot, it is also challenging to track the 
real-time pricing when the token value is jumping constantly up and down.

Since there are more than 3,000 tokens released every day and over 88% of them are classic rugs, 
this is a game where your winners must offset your losses. 
Additionally, a good amount of investment funds and a good strategy are needed to purchase fresh tokens.

The market's season is another consideration. There are times when the memecoin market is booming 
and you can make from 100 to 1000x's a day.

Snipping fresh liquidity locks or burns, if that's the case, then you've ruled out the chance of 
traditional rug pull. Although this strategy is "safer," 
the possible return on investment will be significantly lower because you're purchasing the token later.
## ASD
Most profitable strategy for newly launched tokens is to place amounts per trade like 0.05 sol 
and set the filters by
Token is burned and liquidity is locked
Token is not mintable or freezable
Token metadata is mutable
Token seller fee is disabled
Token creator holdings balance under 5%
Top 10 token holders percentage holdings  not above 50%

We suggest to monitor the profit and manually sell or set an auto-sell!
